A mobile app for all bookworms!
With this app you can store all the highlights, excerpts, takeaways etc from any book you have read and review them whenever you want and wherever you are without carrying the book with you!
If you want to save an excerpt from a real book, just scan the text using this app and it will extract the text for you. Else if it is from an e-book, you can just copy paste the text or take a screenshot and let the app extract the text for you.
Start using our app and remember your takeaways from book you read for a long time!
